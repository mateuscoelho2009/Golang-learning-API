# Golang API

This project intends to be an experimentation while learning how to develop a Golang API. Feel free to contribute!

## Docker

To develop in this project, the only installs you need are [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/ "Docker's Homepage") and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Once you have it installed, run the following commands:

``` bash
~ docker-compose up -d --build
```

And you will have it up and running at port 4000.

## Dependencies

For now, dependencies are put in *src/go.dependencies* file.
